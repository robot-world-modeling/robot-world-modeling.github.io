**Description:**  
*(Please provide a short description of the proposed workshop including a discussion of a list of questions and topics that will guide the conversation in the workshop. Please discuss why this workshop can benefit the robot learning community. Please provide details of the intended audience and what sub-communities presenters and panelists will be drawn from.)* 

“World Model” – a  model of how a world evolves in response to agents’ actions – has been long explored by robotics practitioners. Various perspectives of world modeling have been studied through the lenses of model-based optimal control, reinforcement learning, controllable video generation, dynamic 3D reconstructions, and so on. And it creates significant impacts on the recent development of dexterous manipulation, locomotion, and long-horizon navigation. In particular, powered by large data, the recent advances in the generality and precision of learning-based world models – video generation models and differentiable simulators – show tremendous opportunities in transforming robot learning and optimal control.

The goal of the workshop is to create a space for the robot community to discuss different perspectives of world modeling, as well as the growing impact on robotics. The full-day workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners in robot learningics, physics-based modeling, video generation and 3Dmachine learning to explore the intersection of world modeling and robotic systems. We aim to create a mixture of traditional physics-based approaches and modern learning-based methods, with a focus on building more robust and generalizable robotic systems. By inviting leading experts in these fieldsrobot learning, physics simulation, and video generation models, we hope to spark novel ideas to help advance world modeling and robotics.

**Plans to Encourage Participation:**  
*(Please provide a short description of plans to encourage participation and inclusion from the broader community in your workshop beyond the invited list of speakers. Please provide specific plans for improving the diversity of your workshop participants and giving opportunities to voices not traditionally promoted at academic robotics conferences. Please add a statement of diversity and inclusion efforts)*

We plan to implement the following procedures to encourage broader participation and improve inclusion:

* Call for posters and advertise for workshop participation broadly, with options for both short paper and full paper submissions.  
* Lightning talks of selected posters to encourage junior researchers to publicize their work.  
* Reach out to institutes and faculties in traditionally underrepresented groups, specifically, [Black-in-Robotics](https://blackinrobotics.org/), [Women-in-Robotics](https://www.womeninrobotics.org/), and so on.  
* Advertise on social media, relevant public email lists, other conferences, etc.  
* Adapt a hybrid format (both in-person and virtual participation).  
* Attempt to seek funding for travel support for faculty and students from traditionally underrepresented groups.

Diversity and Inclusion:

**Physical Resources:**   
*(Please provide your estimate of audience size (virtual and in-person) and other physical resources needed for the workshop, e.g., poster boards, etc.)*

We estimate an audience of 50-70 people. We would also like to request at least 10 poster boards for the poster sessions. For the invited talk, lightning talk, and debate, we would need mic, projectors, and camera for facilitating remote speakers as well as audience.
